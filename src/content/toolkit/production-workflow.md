Every investigation starts as a question. Something I noticed that didn't make sense, or a design decision whose consequences seem underexplored.

## Research

I start by reading everything I can find. Academic papers, local news archives, planning commission minutes, patent filings. The goal is to understand the full decision chain: who decided what, when, and with what information.

## Scripting

Scripts go through multiple drafts. The first draft is usually too long and too earnest. I cut aggressively and look for the narrative thread that connects the specific (this intersection, this building, this policy) to the general (how design decisions shape outcomes).

## Production

I shoot with a minimal kit: one camera, a good microphone, and whatever natural light is available. I'm more interested in showing real places than creating polished studio content. The roughness is part of the point.

## Editing

Final Cut Pro for video editing, Logic Pro for audio cleanup. I color grade lightly. The goal is honest representation of places, not cinematic polish.

## Publishing

Videos go to YouTube. Written companions go here. I try to publish both at the same time so they reference each other.

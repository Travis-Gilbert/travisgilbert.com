When I wrote my first draft it was 2:48 AM currently it's 4:34 AM. I keep telling myself that a few more minutes will make me better and that if I push a little bit more somehow that thing I've been looking for that I can't quite find myself Will make its way to the page.

I'm told there are some people in this world who have good thoughts at 2:48 AM God's favorites.
